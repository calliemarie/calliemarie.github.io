		<h2>Attire</h2>
		<p>We want everyone to be as comfortable as possible on our wedding day.  We’re asking the bridesmaids to please order any tea-length regency colored dress from David’s Bridal.</p>  
		<p>Since the ceremony is long and you’ll be standing for most of it, choose whatever dress shoes that you’d like to wear.  Sandals are fine, but please no Chacos until the reception.  Brad, we’ll have more information for you as soon as Grant makes a trip to Men’s Warehouse with his groomsmen.</p>
