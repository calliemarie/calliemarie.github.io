		<h2>How We Met</h2>
			<p> Callie & Grant met in 2010 at Cinderella’s Royal Table inside Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom. Their first  encounter was in January of 2010 when Callie thought Grant was basically a huge jerk.

			<p>A few months passed and a seater told everyone Callie thought Grant was cute (which was true, of course). Eventually, Grant heard the gossip as well and asked Callie out.  A week later they went on their first date in August 2010.</p>
			<p>They’ve gone on quite a few more dates since then.  They love to stay at home with their dogs Kingsley and Thor, and go check out new restaurants and breweries.</p>

		<h2>Our Proposal</h2>
		<p>On December 8th Callie & Grant embarked on the Disney Dream for a 4-night cruise to the Bahamas. This was their joint Christmas present for each other for 2013 and they were both very much looking forward to it.</p>
		<p>On the 3rd night of the Cruise they ate at Palo, a fine dining Italian restaurant on one of the highest decks.  After an amazing dinner, they went out on the private balcony to look out on Nassau.  Grant mentioned that they had gone on a lot of adventures.  He then asked if Callie wanted to go on adventures with him for the rest of her life.  She turned around and he was on one knee asking her to marry him.  She said, “REALLY?!” then “yes, of course!”</p>
